llCrop allows you to either [remove unwanted outer areas from a jpg-photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cropping_(image)) 
or to create zoom-ins.

Just load a jpeg photo, select a rectangle and save the rectangle as a new photo-file.

While there are many apps that can crop images (and may have many more features) these apps cause quality-losses caused by
jpg-re-encoding.

llCrop ("ll" stands for loss-less) can do cropping without quality-losses because it crops in the raw jpg-photo-data without 
the need for jpg-image-re-encoding.
