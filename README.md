llCrop allows you to either [remove unwanted outer areas from a jpg-photo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cropping_(image)) 
or to create zoom-ins.

Just load a jpeg photo, select a rectangle and save the rectangle as a new photo-file.

While there are many apps that can crop images (and may have many more features) these apps cause [quality-losses caused by
jpg-re-encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression).

llCrop ("ll" stands for loss-less) can do [cropping without quality-losses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossy_compression#JPEG) because it crops 
in the raw jpg-photo-data without 
the need for jpg-image-re-encoding. It also preserves embedded meta data (Exif/Iptc and xmp)

The app is available on [f-droid app store](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.k3b.android.lossless_jpg_crop) but not on google-play.

Please wait for the bugfix-version "1.0.2.190515" which should be available in few hours.
