llCrop allows you to either remove unwanted outer areas from a jpg-photo or to create zoom-ins.

Just load a jpeg photo, select a rectangle and save the rectangle as a new photo-file.

Unlike most other photo-cropping software llCrop avoids quality-losses caused by jpg-re-encoding. 
It is processing raw jpg-photo-data. 

"ll" in "llCrop" means "loss-less"
