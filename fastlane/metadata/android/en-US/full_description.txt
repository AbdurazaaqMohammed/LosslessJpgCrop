LLCrop allows you to either remove unwanted outer areas from
a jpg-photo or to create zoom-ins.

Just load a jpeg photo, select a rectangle and save the 
rectangle as a new photo-file.

Unlike most other photo-cropping software LLCrop avoids
quality-losses caused by jpg-re-encoding. 
It is processing raw jpg-photo-data and preserves embedded 
meta data (Exif/Iptc and xmp). 

"LL" in "LLCrop" means "loss-less"
